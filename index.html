		<p class="quote editable">Having a fast and reliable internet connection is paramount for the Derbyshire and
			Lancashire Gliding Club. It allows us access weather, Notam and other websites so that we can plan our flying
			operations safely.
			A small business in today’s world is reliant on great connectivity to ensure that it is in touch with all its
			customers.
			Hucklow Net has provided a service that not only meets all our needs and expectations but significantly exceeds
			them and we are extremely happy to be part of this community project.</p>

		<p class="quote editable">Having a good internet connection has improved the prospects of letting our industrial
			units and offices in Great
			Hucklow.
			These offices allow people to work in the local area, keeping jobs in the Peak District. This in turn keeps
			people buying
			lunches and mileage down, travelling a few miles rather than travelling into Sheffield, Buxton, or Manchester.
			The project has also had a wider impact on the local community, keeping young people in the area.</p>

		<p class="quote editable">The stress and strain of not having proper Internet access to complete homework and study
			for GCSE’s meant my child and
			other children in our village were at a massive disadvantage compared with their peers.
			Study time and research time was almost doubled with the poor access provided by BT which led to very grumpy and
			frustrated children.

			As parents we felt very in adequate to help until HucklowNet offered to supply our village with superfast fibre.

			This meant a lot of hard work for adults and children alike with days and days of digging and pulling but it was
			so
			worth it. The whole village is now benefiting.

			5 GCSE students are now eagerly awaiting their results this summer with five more that will be studying hard over
			the
			next few years, the whole process being so much easier with your services.

			Thank you so much for taking on Abney it is amazing how something so small can be so life changing.</p>
