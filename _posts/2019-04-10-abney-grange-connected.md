We've been working hard this spring to complete the Abney expansion project.

Today we hit a big milestone, our first house in Abney Grange has been connected!

The HucklowNet team and residents alike are delighted, and we all want to thank the hard work that the community has been doing over the last few months to get this project moving.

Over the next week or so, we should be connecting the rest of the homes in the hamlet of Abney Grange, and then moving onto the village of Abney.
