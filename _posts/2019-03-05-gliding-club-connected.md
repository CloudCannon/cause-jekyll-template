It is our pleasure to announce that the Great Hucklow Gliding Club have been connected to the HucklowNet network.

The Gliding club have been instrumental in our Abney expansion project, hosting vital powered equipment in their clubhouse.

We can now begin to move onto connecting Abney and Abney Grane, to serve a community that has been let down by BT and the Government.
